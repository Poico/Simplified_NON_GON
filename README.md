**Simplified_NON_GON** is a Collision Detection Toolbox for Unity and the Web that efficiently processes smooth convex object interactions using proximity queries and minimum closest distance algorithms.

Proximity queries determine how close two objects are without detecting actual collisions, enabling early rejection of non-colliding pairs and refining narrow-phase collision checks.

Minimum closest distance algorithms calculate the smallest separation between objects, ensuring precise proximity detection with or without penetration.
